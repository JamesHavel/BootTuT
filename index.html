        <h1>Welcome to Bootstrap!</h1>

        <legend>Boy you're going to have fun with this...</legend>

        <p>Bootstrap is a fairly complex (in my opinion, but do mind I consider myself a junior dev) framework. It can be downloaded from <a href="getbootstrap.com" style="font-weight: bold;">here</a>. It can be pretty easy if you can remember a bunch of new / different html styles, css classes and ID's, and all the likes. It's a sort of "controlling" type of framework. If you know how to follow guidelines it can be very, very beneficial. If you can't, well... I guess this guide can help you!</p>

        <p>You can do <b>TONS</b> of different things. Containers, styles, responsive utilities, tables, images, forms, formatting code, columns, using clearfix, button styles, breakpoints. Absolutely anything that you can think of. I try my best to style this to make it easy to understand, follow, and learn from. I'll update it as I feel I have the time / motivation to do so, but I won't make any promises. Sorry lads!</p>

        <h3>Lets talk buisness.</h3>

        <p>The way the information is going to be set up is section by section. You will have the first section with a white background, and the second section with a different background color to better tell what is different from what, and to better tell what code goes with what example. Everything will be laid out really simple so if you honestly have trouble telling A from B, I don't really know what to say.</p>

        <p>If you think something should be added, or want to suggest an improvement to the website, or even see something wrong or out of date, shoot an email over to <b>Warriorsfuryq@yahoo.com</b>. I'll respond as swiftly as I can, and if anything is changed you'll both be informed, and thanked on the site where the edit is for the improvement.</p>

        <p>"Why not make this like a Wikipedia type website?" Honestly, thats a pretty good idea. But at first I want this website to be a site that I uphold myself, to see what kind of work load it would put on me. All of that and i'm not really sure how to keep develop a lot of the features that a Wikipedia type of website should withhold. I'm a mere 19 year old boy that is still learning haha.</p>

        <legend>Support</legend>

        <header class="bgimageDefault">
          <div class="container">
            <p>If anyone needs help, as I said just shoot me an email. Or honestly if you would prefer a more instant form of communication, my <b>discord</b> id is: Warriorsfury#3907 <b>or</b> you can use my email to add me as well.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>"Hey, are you looking for any help?"</b></li>
              <p>Not at the moment, no not entirely. Not unless you feel like teaching me things such as how I would go about setting up bourbon on a Windows 10 computer. (Yes I know there are tutorials, I just find them difficult.) Things like Git, and Git Bash, whatever those are. The command line, powershell? I don't really understand them yet fully... How I would go about making / installing / customizing a CMS. How to make / install / customize a ecommerance platform in a website? Those are the two MAJOR things I need to learn but just can't quite find a good resource on teaching me.</p>
              <li><b>"Are you looking for donations?"</b></li>
              <p>No, I did not make this with money in the mind absolutely what so ever. I made this for practice, and to see if I can help someone else as well.</p>
              <li><b>"How are you learning? Do you go to college?"</b></li>
              <p>Unfortunately I don't go to college. I do not have <i>nearly</i> enough resources to go to a good college that is up to date on common practices and <i>teaches me things I need to know</i>. I tried it for a semested but the negative HEAVILY outweighed the positive in my opinion for the time. I currently teach myself <b>everything.</b></p>
              <li><b>"Are you looking for an internship of sorts?"</b></li>
              <p>Honestly? Yes. I would absolutely LOVE to be able to do an internship somewhere to learn. But I would have to find the right one, as I currently need a sort of income to hold me up and help me save for the future. I want to be safe.</p>
              <li><b>"Where did you learn Bootstrap yourself?"</b></li>
              <p>The website of <b><a href="lynda.com">Lynda.com</a></b> infact, some examples from there are used from here. But I want to say that Lynda is a WONDERFUL website to learn MANY (And I mean many, like damn) different things. I personally <i>don't</i> like subscribing to things, especially if it's expensive. But I feel that Lynda is actually worth it. With exercise files, videos, and hell, even a transcript of each video with awesome features. That place will have you set, check it out!</p>
            </ul>
            <p>Hopefully anything above answers most of your questions. Again. If you have a question just come chat with me, I love to talk about most things! And it's always wonderful to meet new people. Cheers!</p>
